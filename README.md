## Learning Objectives

- Understand the theory and intuition behind Autoencoders
- Import Key libraries, dataset and visualize images
- Perform image normalization, pre-processing, and add random noise to images
- Build an Autoencoder using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend
- Compile and fit Autoencoder model to training data 
- Assess the performance of trained Autoencoder using various KPIs 

## Walkthrough

- Import libraries and datasets
- Perform data visualization
- Perform data preprocessing
- Understand the theory and intuition behind autoencoders
- Build and train autoencoder model
- Evaluate trained model performance

## FMNIST Dataset
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.
